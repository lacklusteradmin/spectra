//! Every request core sends to a chain service, and the parsing of its answer.
//!
//! One module per `EndpointApi`, named after its `as_str()`: each is that wire
//! contract's reads and submissions, whichever chain uses it. `utxo` is the one
//! module that spans several APIs — the UTXO family's client over them and the
//! answer types they share. `http` and `json_rpc` are the transport under all
//! of them, `time` the provider timestamps they read.
//!
//! `api` depends on nothing but the transport and `registry`: `fetch`, `send`,
//! `staking` and `service` call it, never the other way round. Building and
//! signing transactions is per chain and lives in `send`.
