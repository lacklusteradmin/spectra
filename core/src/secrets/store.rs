//! `SecretStore` — UniFFI callback trait for platform-backed secret storage.
//!
//! Swift (and future Android) implements this interface and hands an instance
//! to `WalletService::set_secret_store`. Rust then drives all secret I/O through
//! it, keeping raw key material out of Rust-owned memory and letting each
//! platform apply its strongest available protection (Secure Enclave / StrongBox).
//!
//! Design notes:
//! - Callers classify every secret with a `SecretClass` so the platform layer
//!   can route to the correct Keychain service / Android keystore and apply the
//!   right accessibility attributes. Classification lives on the Rust side so
//!   policy is uniform across platforms; the adapter only maps class → backend.
//! - Methods return `Result` with a structured `SecretStoreError`, separating
//!   "key absent" (`NotFound`) from backend failures (`Backend`) and the
//!   pre-registration state (`Unavailable`).
//! - Values are opaque `String`s. Callers decide encoding (base64/hex/JSON).
//! - All methods are synchronous from the foreign side; UniFFI wraps them in a
//!   blocking executor. Keychain I/O is fast enough that blocking is fine.
