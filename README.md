# Spectra

[![CI](https://github.com/Sheny6n/SpectraWallet/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Sheny6n/SpectraWallet/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Spectra is a prelaunch, multi-chain self-custodial crypto wallet focused on
custody, payments, recovery and staking. It aims to be approachable for everyday
use while exposing the network settings, diagnostics and logs advanced users need.

## Product direction

- Local-first, privacy-conscious software that keeps users in control of their
  keys and wallet data.
- Consistent send, receive, history and backup flows across chains.
- Broad import and recovery support, including legacy wallet conventions and
  watch-only wallets.
- Configurable endpoints and providers, exportable diagnostics, and clear
  transaction verification states.
- Biometric protection, optional wallet passwords, customizable dashboards and
  staking where chain support makes sense.

Spectra does not aim to become a trading terminal or a swap-first product;
custody and payments take priority over speculative features and purchase
upsells.

## Development

One Rust wallet core serves several front ends: the `spectra` CLI, a native
SwiftUI iOS app, and an Android skeleton. Core owns domain state and decisions;
the front ends render its results and forward user intent.

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): the rules for working in this repository, Rule 0
  first. Read first.
- [Open items](docs/OPEN-ITEMS.md): remaining work and known limitations.
- [Behaviour changes](docs/BEHAVIOUR-CHANGES.md): what changed on purpose, and why.
- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): design decisions and ownership boundaries.
- [FFI boundary](docs/FFI-BOUNDARY.md): UniFFI 0.31 and Swift 6 integration.
- [iOS UI](docs/IOS-UI.md): layout, typography and Liquid Glass rules.

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain, so `cargo` installs the right one on
first use and no version needs naming here.

### The CLI

The CLI is the front end with no platform under it. It needs nothing but a Rust
toolchain:

```sh
cargo run -p spectra_cli -- --help
```

### The iOS app

Open `swift/Spectra.xcodeproj` and build. The Xcode “Build Rust Core” phase
runs `scripts/build-ios.sh`, which compiles the Rust core for the device or the
arm64 simulator and generates `swift/generated/` from it, so a fresh clone needs
no separate step. Simulators are arm64 only. The Swift bindings are **not** checked
in; never hand-edit `swift/generated/` — change the Rust API and rebuild.

### Verification

Three suites gate a change, and `make verify` runs all of them:

```sh
make verify
```

| Target | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `make lint` | `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, unused-code source scans |
| `make test` | `cargo test --workspace` |
| `make test-cli` | `scripts/cli-acceptance.sh` — the real binary end to end, offline, throwaway data directory |
| `make test-ios` | `xcodebuild test` on an iPhone simulator |
| `make check-ui` | design-token and icon-normalization checks |

CI runs everything except `test-ios`, which needs Xcode and a simulator.
